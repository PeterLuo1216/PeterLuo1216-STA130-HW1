However, the purchase_date column has a very high percentage of missing values, while the customer_id, review_text, rating, and recommendation columns are relatively complete.At this case, I prefer to remove columns with a high percentage of missing values rather than removing rows.\n",

    "7-3: Discuss why applying del df['col'] before df.dropna() when both are used together could be important\n",

    "    Because applying del df['col'] before df.dropna() helps you to Reduce the dataset’s complexity and size and improves performance. It also Preventsg unnecessary data loss by focusing row removal on relevant columns only.Lastly, it clarifies the data cleaning focus and avoiding redundant operations.\n",

    "    In my original dataset, The quote column had 5 missing values, which is relatively high compared to the other columns. Removing it simplifies the dataset and prevents the need to handle a larger proportion of missing data. After removing the less useful column, we applied df.dropna() to remove rows with missing values in the phrase column. This approach ensures that all remaining data is complete and clean, making it suitable for analysis. By removing the quote column and dropping rows with missing values in phrase, we effectively cleaned the dataset while retaining important information. The resulting dataset no longer contains missing values, making it more reliable for further analysis.\n",

    "ChatBot Session Summaries\n",
    "1. Missing Data Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "In our ChatBot session, we discussed strategies for handling missing data in pandas DataFrames. We explored different methods and their use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "df.dropna(): This method is used to remove rows with missing values. It's useful when you want to ensure that all data used in analysis is complete, which can be important for statistical accuracy. For example, if a dataset contains critical rows with missing values that should not be used in analysis, df.dropna() helps in cleaning the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "del df['col']: This method is used to remove a column from the DataFrame. It is preferred when a column has a high percentage of missing values and its removal will simplify the dataset. For instance, if a column is not essential for the analysis or contains too many missing entries, it is more efficient to remove it rather than dealing with incomplete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we discussed why it might be important to use del df['col'] before applying df.dropna(). Removing unnecessary columns first can prevent the dropna() method from being applied to columns that are not needed, thus avoiding redundant data processing and ensuring a cleaner dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DataFrame Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "During the ChatBot session, we covered how to determine the number of rows and columns in a pandas DataFrame using df.shape. This method returns a tuple that represents the dimensions of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations: Each row in the DataFrame represents a single data point or observation. For example, in the Titanic dataset, each row might represent a passenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: Each column represents a variable or feature that describes the observations. For instance, columns like \"Age\", \"Sex\", and \"Fare\" in the Titanic dataset are variables that describe different aspects of each passenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Summarizing Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed how to provide simple summaries of columns in a DataFrame. The df.describe() method provides descriptive statistics for each numerical column, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Count: Number of non-null entries in each column.\n",
    "Mean: Average value of the entries.\n",
    "Std: Standard deviation, which measures the dispersion of the values.\n",
    "Min: Minimum value in the column.\n",
    "25%, 50%, 75%: The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, which provide insight into the distribution of the data.\n",
    "Max: Maximum value in the column.\n",
    "For categorical data, df.describe(include=['object']) can be used to get counts and unique values for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Grouping and Describing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We explored the df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe() method. This code groups the data by the unique values in \"col1\" and then computes descriptive statistics for \"col2\" within each group. For example, grouping by \"Sex\" and describing \"Age\" will provide summary statistics for ages within each gender group in the Titanic dataset."
